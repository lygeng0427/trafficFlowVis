## Project Overview

The rapid evolution of urban transportation demands innovative approaches to traffic management and planning. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques and the d3.js library to visualize traffic flow interactions, providing insights that help in urban planning and management.

### Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Using LangSAM for object detection and tracking within complex urban street scenes.
- **Data Visualization**: Employing the d3.js library to represent traffic flow interactions dynamically and interactively.
- **Object Tracking**: Implementation of a simple object tracking algorithm to enrich our analysis with temporal data insights.
